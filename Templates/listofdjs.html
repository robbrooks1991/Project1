                of the best house and techno DJs in the world. He is married with one child. As someone with access to the internet, all this information is easily available to you. Berkhahn lives what we might (pretentiously) call an ‘examined life’;
                interviews with, profiles of and, obviously, music by Dixon are just as Googleable as anything else. Perhaps this is why, over recent years, Berkhahn has tended to decline interview requests — maybe he feels he’s been “examined” quite

                both magical mystery and muted melancholy he enchanted onlookers with occult instruments and beguiling sounds. Forever surrounded by a sense of intrigue, the world soon cottoned on to the elusive yet enchanting musical powers of this otherworldly
                beast. The results are that today his shamanistic sonic powers take him all around the world.</p>
